<p>This is my favourite anime. Attack on Titan had incredible standards of animation, both in the fluidity of its motion, and the beauty and detail of the art style. My Favorite character in it is Eren Yaegar.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>

<p>Demon Slayer's animation is top-notch and one of the best in the anime industry. I personally love Nezukooo chan!</p>
<h3>Naruto / Naruto Shippuden</h3>

<p>Naruto's plot is highly addictive and has captivated anime fans worldwide with its mysteries, questions, and potential conclusions. The franchise features captivating story arcs, such as the Chunin Exams Arc, Five Kage Summit Arc, Pain Invasion Arc, and the Fourth Great Ninja War, all showcasing Kishimoto's visionary writing.
   Naruto Uzumaki's journey as an underdog hero, starting as an unwanted orphan and becoming Hokage. Overall, Kishimoto does an excellent job of keeping the audience hooked until the very end.</p>
